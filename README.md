# TailWind-CSS

CSS TAILWIND LIBRARY

**Notes**

```
Tailwind does not give you predefined componets
like navbars which is what bootstrap does for instance.

It instead offers you with a set of mutiple utility classes
which you may use.Making your site more customizable.

Notice that bootstrap is also advanatgeous in building a website
faster but most websites build via bootstrap almost look the same.

You can change tailwind default settings eg responsiveness
and default container settings by including a config.css
To generate one we run npx tailwind init
```
